# CIS600-ResearchProject

This is the repo for my CIS 600 research project at Syracuse University.

This project involves predicting the value of various cryptocurrencies using various machine learning models such as 
linear regression, decision trees, and gradient boosting. These predictions will be visualized using matplotlib and the
models will be provided from scikit-learn.
